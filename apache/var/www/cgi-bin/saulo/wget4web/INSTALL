Installation
============
Unpack wget4web-1.0.tar.gz. Copy directory wget4web in cgi-bin
directory in your Web server. Configuration files are located
in the directory cgi-bin/wget4web/data/ :

    * info.cgi - directory paths, primary settings
    * users.cgi - list of users. File format:
      user_name|password[|admin]
      For example by default register administrator Black with
      password qwerty and user Jack with password 12345. You must
      change this logins/passwords to yours.

I recommend for work with downloaded files to create a new user
without shell (for that write /bin/exit in shell setting) and ftp
access. In home directory to create subdirectories files (permissions
777), logs (permissions 755, the owner coincide with the owner of Web
server) and tasks (permissions 755, the owner coincide with the owner
of Web server). Then all who knows login/password of created user can
take downloaded file on ftp and delete it (also as the other users),
but can not change service information.
