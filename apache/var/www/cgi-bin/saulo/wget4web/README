Summary information
===================
Wget4web allows to add downloads to server, to view information
about download status and to  control it in browser. The program's
interface is look like interfaces of ReGet and Downloader for X,
what allow to control download of many files without review Wget
logs (but if you want to do it, you may watch them in browser window).
Wget4web writes logs and can generate reports including name and size
of downloaded files. You can control traffic which was got by each
user. Users can download files without using shell (Wget4web
use own user list) what decrease possibility of undesirable
server usage.

System requirements
===================
Wget4web use Wget, Perl and Web server (for example Apache).

Wget4web created for OS Linux, but it can work also in Windows.
For this purpose you can download Wget for Windows.

Installation
============
Unpack wget4web-1.0.tar.gz. Copy directory wget4web in cgi-bin
directory in your Web server. Configuration files are located
in the directory cgi-bin/wget4web/data/ :

    * info.cgi - directory paths, primary settings
    * users.cgi - list of users. File format:
      user_name|password[|admin]
      For example by default register administrator Black with
      password qwerty and user Jack with password 12345. You must
      change this logins/passwords to yours.

I recommend for work with downloaded files to create a new user
without shell (for that write /bin/exit in shell setting) and ftp
access. In home directory to create subdirectories files (permissions
777), logs (permissions 755, the owner coincide with the owner of Web
server) and tasks (permissions 755, the owner coincide with the owner
of Web server). Then all who knows login/password of created user can
take downloaded file on ftp and delete it (also as the other users),
but can not change service information.

Work with program
=================
If you setup program as stated above then for access to Wget4web
scripts you must write:
http://server_name/cgi-bin/wget4web/script_name.cgi
where script_name.cgi can assume the following values:

    * add.cgi - adding a new file for download. You must enter URL,
      login and password.
    * progress.cgi - shows download statistic
    * admincenter.cgi - the administration center. For entering in this
      section you must enter login and password. Here you can get
      information about traffic and downloaded files, stop downloads
      (user can stop only own download, administrator - all downloads).
