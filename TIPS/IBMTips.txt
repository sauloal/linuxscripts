find 		plumbs the depths of the named directory -- in this case, the file system starting at . or dot (shorthand for
			the current working directory) -- and emits the names of all entries that match the given criteria. Here, 
			-type f directs find to discover only plain files.
sort		as its name implies, processes a list and emits a new list that's sorted alphabetically.
uniq 		(pronounced "unique") scans a list, comparing adjacent elements in the list and removing any duplicates. 
			For instance, suppose you have this list:

	$ rename 's/\.bak$//' *.bak
	$ rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *
It's not clobberin' time
	$ alias mv=mv -i
	$ alias rm=rm -i
	$ set -o noclobber
	The first two commands replace mv with mv -i and rm with rm -i, respectively, at the command line. 
	Interactive mode forces you to confirm your action.

	The third command provides a modicum of safety in the shell itself. With noclobber on, you can't accidentally
	 overwrite a file using the > redirection operator:
	To disable noclobber, type:
	set +o noclobber

Speaking UNIX, Part 10: Customize your shell

	Here, the quirky command line ^heroes^villains substitutes the word villains for heroes in the immediately 
	previous command (the default, if a numbered command in the history list isn't provided) and runs the result, 
	ls -l villians.txt. Consult your shell's documentation for its syntax for command-line substitutions.
		$ ls -l heroes.txt
		-rw-r--r--   1 strike  strike  174 Mar  1 11:25 heroes.txt
		$ ^heroes^villains
		ls -l villians.txt

	$ printenv
	...
	EDITOR=vi
	...
	$ EDITOR="pico" less bigfile
	This combination pages bigfile in less. If you type v in less to edit the file, pico is launched instead of vi. 

	  You can find copies of Perl in both /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin. To find which Perl you're using, type type perl.
	$ perl -v 
	This is perl, v5.8.7 built for darwin-2level
	$ type perl
	perl is /use/local/bin/perl
	$ type -a perl
	perl is /usr/local/bin/perl
	perl is /usr/bin/perl
	$ type -a -w perl
	perl: command
	perl: command
	
	$ find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -1
	./Business Plan 2007
	./Expense Report
	./Pictures from Spain

	$ find . -iname '*music*' -type f -follow -print 

	The ps command runs (listing the user's current processes), followed by w (which shows who is using the machine), 
	and the collected output is captured in a file. 	
	$ { ps; w } > state.`date '+%F'`

	export LESS="-Nmsx4"
		* -N displays line numbers.
		* -m displays the current position in the file as a percentage.
		* s "squeezes," or reduces, multiple blank lines into a single blank line.
		* -x4 sets a tab stop every four spaces.
